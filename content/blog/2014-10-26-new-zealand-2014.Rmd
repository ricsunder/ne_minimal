##### Day 2, Oct 28th 2014

* The day was overcast and it was misty outside and we decided to go away from Auckland
* After a nice breakfast, we went to the Ferry Terminal
* Took a Ferry to Waiheke Island
* After arriving at Waiheke, we walked to the Oneroa beach. The walk was pleasant and we passed through small house. We were surprised to find out many were listed above $500K
* The water was cold, but we still enjoyed the secluded beach to ourself
* Ater that we went to Vino Vino restaurant and enjoyed coffee and snacks
* To catch the last ferry, we took the bus back to ferry Terminal
* Arrived in Auckland later in the evening. Since it was raining we stayed indoors, but 3 from the group decided to go out and see the nightlife
* We found people were genuinely interested in talking with foreigners

##### Day 3, Oct 29th 2014

* The sun was finally out
* After breakfast we went to Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life aquarium
* Since we did not have a car and this was pre-Uber era we were travelling everywhere by the local bus. This itself was an adventure
* Aquarium had a diverse sea life and lots of penguins
* After the aquarium we went to Little India restaurant to get lunch
* It was almost late afternoon and we had a flight next day, so we just walked around the downtown area. Auckland is just like any major city, and in the future one can completely skip the northern island

##### Day 4, Oct 30th 2014

* After breakfast, went to the airport to take the early morning flight to Christchurch
* The flight was another opportunity to see the New Zealand landscape of oceans, mountains and green pastures
* We were picked up at the airport by our tour guide Gary
* Checked into the hotel and explored the Christchurch area
* It was sad to see all the devastation from the earthquake and the city was still recovering with many businesses being closed
* Since most restaurant were not open, we ate dinner at Southern Asian Restaurant
* This was different than many American Chinese restaurants
* At night we decided to walk around the city, but the city was deserted and there were random shoes left around town
* This freaked us out and we went to the hotel

##### Day 6, Oct 31th 2014

* Our driver Gary, picked us up and dropped us at the Train Station
* From there we took the Tranz Alpine Scenic Train
* The train went from Christchurch to Greymouth. It cuts across the Southern Alps through Arthurs Pass
* It was a scenic ride and we saw many mountains, lakes and waterfalls
* After arriving at Greymounth Gary picked us up again at the station
* From there we left for Hokitika. We had to pick another member of the family
* Hokitika had nothing much to do, other than an airport
* After the pickup, we left for Franz Josef
* The drive along the western cost of New Zealand was beautiful. The ocean was inviting, but the water is just too cold and the winds are too high. Even the trees were bent
* The town of Franz Josef provides an access to the two best glaciers - Franz Josef glacier and Fox Glaciers. We were excited to take the helicopter ride and booked it that evening
* Had dinner at King Tiger restaurant. Best Chicken Vindaloo ever

##### Day 7, Nov 1 2014

* The weather was not suitable for flying the helicopter and our Heli Glacier Hike tour was canceled
* We were very disappointed, but flying in this region can be dangerous if the weather is bad. There was an accident, recently in this region
* We decided to go on our own hike instead
* Equipped with some umbrellas, ponchos and an infant in a stroller we started hiking towards Roberts point track
* The hike had many waterfalls, small wooded bridges and rocky paths along the way. As we approached the glacier, it got very cold and it was also very breezy. We did not have proper jackets. Yet we managed to get some picture and headed back to the hotel
* After the hike we were hungry and ate again at King Tiger restaurant. It was again Chicken Vindaloo

##### Day 8, Nov 2 2014

* The next morning after breakfast we continued our journey towards Wanaka

* We checked into our hotel which was a nice place, with big lawns and water views.
* We rented some bicycles and drove them around the water and into town
* The sun set was beautiful and we sat by the lake and enjoyed it
* For dinner we had burritos and quesadillas at Amigos Mexican grill
* We also met our tour agent, who was a very nice person

##### Day 15, Nov 9 2014

* Left New Zealand. Flight out from Queenstown to Auckland, then Auckland to Papeete
* We had a 2 nights free in Tahiti deal with our air tickets
* But since we reached Tahiti late at night we selected a hotel near the airport
* It was disappointing, the night manager was rude, and it appears that he may had assigned our rooms to someone else
* After an intense argument, we got more rooms, but we didnt sleep well
* The next morning the main manager offered a free bus ride to our next hotel which was 30 mins away
* We were really tired and spent the whole day at the resort pool and ate at the resort restaurant

##### Day 16, Nov 10 2014

* The next morning we left for Moorea island
* The water there was so clear that you could see the fish swimming underneath and it was shallow so no swimming was required
* We went on our excusrsion which was to swim with the sharks and stingrays
* It was incredibly thrilling to be surrounded by potentially deadly animals. Although they were domesticated by seeing so many tourists, you never know what may piss them off
* The tour did not have vegeterian food, so we managed with fruits and rice
* For dinner we went to Downtown Papeete, to eat at the Les Roulottes (food trucks)

##### Day 17, Nov 11 2014

* Since our flight was at night, we spent the morning again at the resort pool
* After some back and forth with the tour operator on not providing vegeterian food, they agreed to provide us a free airport transport
* We left for the airport in the evening
* There was an announcement at the airport that the fligt might get canceled, it was scary for a while, since everybody was missing good'ol USA and wanted to be back
* Luckily the flight left on time and we made it home back home safely
