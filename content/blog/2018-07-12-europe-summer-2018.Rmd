##### Day 4

* After an amazing day at Schilthorn, it was onto Jungfraujoch. Also know as "Top of Europe".
* We started early morning and were lucky to get seats on the train without reservation.
* We took the train from Grindelwald to Kleine Scheidegg, and then a special mountain [train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVxONJO3-rs) up to Jungfraujoch
* The train traveled through some of the best sceneries in Swizerland. We travelled through mountains, tunnels and enjoyed views of glaciers.
* After reaching the top we spent the whole day having fun on the snow.
* After getting down, we enjoyed good lunch at Kleine Scheidegg, and a short hike.
* After reaching the hotel around 4 pm, we still have the whole evning left and decided to take the train to Interlaken. We rented bicyles and strolled around the city and the lake.

##### Day 5

* On day 5 we decided to take the train to [Mount Titlis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvJj4BfD40). 
* We took the train from Interlaken to Engelberg and then a bus to Mount Titlis.
* On our way we passed through the beautiful town of [Lungern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYywGiwudk). After enjoying the mountains this town looked like a great way to relax. But we did not have time to do that. 
* Once we reached Mount Titlis we took the gondola to the top. After Schilthorn and Jungfraujoch, Titlis felt a little underwhelming.
* The facilities were not upto Swiss standards and nothing was open.
* We ate late lunch at an Indian restaurant and took the 3 hour train ride back to Grindelwald and got ready to say goodbye to the Jungfraujoch region

##### Day 6

* Left for Zermatto enjoy the Matterhorn
* The train ride was incredible, it was part of the Glacier Express train
* Unfortunately when we  reached the hotel the weather did not cooperate with us in Zermat
* It rained the whole day, we stayed indoors and enjoyed a quite dinner at an Italian restaurant

##### Day 7

* The rain finally stopped the next day but the day was overcast
* We could not take the train to the Matterhorn, so decided to split
* One group went hiked to the suspension bridge from Randa
* The hike was about 5.5 km each way. The bridge was at a height of 2000 meters and 494 meters long.
* Other group went to the [Gorner Gorge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faov0Vb2D70)
* Had cake that evening on a special occasion

##### Day 8

* Left Zermat and took the train to Venice
* Reached Venice in the afternoon. After checkin, left by train to the old town.
* Visited Saint Mark's Square and enjoyed pizza and pasta at the restaurant
* Visited Rialto Bridge and had coffee at a nearby cafe.
* Venice is a beautiful city, but it is overwhelmed by tourists, and tavelling from one place to another is incredibly difficult. It must be taking a big toll on the locals
* We decided to go back to the hotel

##### Day 9

* After breakfast, left to board the cruise
* After getting into the rooms, we checked out the other facilities
* Norwegian cruise did not create a good first impression. Staterooms were old, food was alright and procedure to embark and disembark passengers was time consuming
* Spent the first night at sea on the way to Bar.

##### Day 10

* First Port of call was Bar, Montenegro
* It was really a last minute substitution for Kotor
* It is a small town, in a small country
* After a quick taxi ride, we visited the Old Town (Taxi fare 5 euro)
* The taxi's were old, run down Mercedez sedans, traffic was light and the drivers eager to drop you off at your destination and pick up the next passenger
* The Old Town had narrow lanes, filled with vendors trying to sell souvenirs. The only attraction was the Old Bar fort which we skipped and enjoyed nice coffee and baklava instead
* I am glad we got to spend some time here, and we can check off Montenegro from the list of countries visited. The people were friendly, food was good, weather was Mediterranean and for some reason there were many cats

##### Day 11

* The next port of call was Corfu, Greece
* Corfu is a small greek island, close to southern Italy. After disembarking, we got a taxi (again Mercedes) and the driver took us to a small but beautiful beach [Agios Spiridon Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbQU_0aA-78) in Paleokastritsa 
* We got on a small boat, and went exploring small caves and grottos. The water was blue and clear, and surrounded by high cliffs and rock formation.
* After the boat ride we went to a restaurant Vrachos Palaiokastritsa. We ate salad with cheese, pasta, bread and hummus and wine. The food and the sunset summed up a great day in corfu.

##### Day 12

* The next port of call in Santorini and the boat docked at 11 am
* The cruise ship docks away from port in Santorini and then you take a smaller boat to the island. Since the water was choppy that day the disembarkation process was chaotic.
* After waiting a while, we finally disembarked and reached the island. The process was not easy.
* We only had a few hours to spend, and it was very crowded in the market
* We managed to get a few pictures, get a meal and drinks and shop for some souvenirs
* The sunset was pretty, but we watched it from the line to get back on the ship
* Given the logistical challenges one day is not enough, 2-3 day trip is required to fully enjoy the island

##### Day 13

* Mykonos was the last port of call in Greece
* Mykonos has a reputation for being a party island, and we decided to relax at the beach
* We went to paradise beach and had drinks at the bar and relaxed 
* This was a much need rest after two weeks of travel
* Later we enjoyed a nice meal by the water and shopped for more souvenirs

##### Day 14

* After almost two weeks of travel we were somewhat tired, but Dubrovnik is a special place and we were excited
* Unfortunately the weather was really bad (it was raining and there were very high winds)
* Despite this we decided to visit the Red Keep
* The windy/rainy weather made it extremely challenging to walk around the castle. The castle walls were about waist high and it was both scary and exciting to walk around
* After the visit we went to our favorite restaurant Dubravka and enjoyed pizza. As were eating the rain stopped and we got a slight view of blue sky, but it was short lived and it started raining again.
